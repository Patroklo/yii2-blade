## Instalation

* Install [Yii 2](http://www.yiiframework.com/download)
* Install package via [composer](http://getcomposer.org/download/) `"cyneek/yii2-blade": "*"`
* Update config file _'config/web.php'_

```php

...
'components' => [
        'view' => [
            'class' => 'yii\web\View',
            'renderers' => [
                'blade' => [
                    'class' => '\cyneek\yii2\blade\ViewRenderer',
                    'cachePath' => '@runtime/blade_cache',
                ],
            ],
        ],
]
...
```


* Make a _blade_cache_ directory in your @runtime directory writable by the web user.
* Profit!

## Parameters

* **cachePath** [String/Required] Directory where Blade Layout system will store the view files once they are treated. Should be writable by the web server user (for example www-data).
* **viewPaths** [String[]/Optional] Array holding a list of directories where views and layouts will be stored. This is not really necessary since the system will get the view paths once they are retrieved to the Blade Wrapper.
* **extension** [String/Optional] It you are going to use another extension than `.blade` for your view files, it should be stated here as well as in the array key of the renderers array.

### Using the `layout` parameter

It's possible to define the controller's parameter `layout` with a Blade file. But since the Yii2 view render system it's not 100% compatible with the Blade Layout rendering, you'll have to add a behavior to that controller called `BladeBehavior` that will integrate both systems. 

To add this behavior you'll only have to include:


```php
    public function behaviors()
    {
        return [
            ...
            'blade' => [
                'class' => BladeBehavior::className()
            ],
            ...
        ];
    }
```

Then the layout view file will be rendered before the views if both layout and view files have a blade file extension. If not, Yii2 normal rendering system will be used instead.

### Using the `$view` instead of `$this` 
The object `$this` can't be used in Blade templates due to compatibility problems with the Blade system callings.

So, instead of this object I made the `$view` object that has the same functionalities than the `$this` in a normal layout system.

For example , if you want to pass `$this->title` from content view to layout view, just use `$view->title` ,and in the layout view , you can get title by using `$this->title`.

### Blade template instructions

The Laravel framework documentation has an extensive guide about how to work with Blade template system. Everything should be compatible with this module since it uses the same libraries in the background.
